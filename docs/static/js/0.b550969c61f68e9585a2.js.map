This is a complex parameter; see\n  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#open} for details.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [tabIndex=0]\n  *     Tabbing order index to assign to the viewer element. Positive values are selected in increasing order. When tabIndex is 0\n  *     source order is used. A negative value omits the viewer from the tabbing order.\n  *\n  * @property {Array} overlays Array of objects defining permanent overlays of\n  *     the viewer. The overlays added via this option and later removed with\n  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#removeOverlay} will be added back when a new\n  *     image is opened.\n  *     To add overlays which can be definitively removed, one must use\n  *     {@link OpenSeadragon.Viewer#addOverlay}\n  *     If displaying a sequence of images, the overlays can be associated\n  *     with a specific page by passing the overlays array to the page's\n  *     tile source configuration.\n  *     Expected properties:\n  *     * x, y, (or px, py for pixel coordinates) to define the location.\n  *     * width, height in point if using x,y or in pixels if using px,py.

Finally the\n  *     image paths, by default assume there is a folder on the servers root path\n  *     called '/images', eg '/images/zoomin_rest.png'.  If you need to adjust\n  *     these paths, prefer setting the option.prefixUrl rather than overriding\n  *     every image path directly through this setting.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [debugMode=false]\n  *     TODO: provide an in-screen panel providing event detail feedback.\n  *\n  * @property {String} [debugGridColor=['#437AB2', '#1B9E77', '#D95F02', '#7570B3', '#E7298A', '#66A61E', '#E6AB02', '#A6761D', '#666666']]\n  *     The colors of grids in debug mode. Each tiled image's grid uses a consecutive color.\n  *     If there are more tiled images than provided colors, the color vector is recycled.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [blendTime=0]\n  *     Specifies the duration of animation as higher or lower level tiles are\n  *     replacing the existing tile.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [alwaysBlend=false]\n  *     Forces the tile to always blend.  By default the tiles skip blending\n  *     when the blendTime is surpassed and the current animation frame would\n  *     not complete the blend.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [autoHideControls=true]\n  *     If the user stops interacting with the viewport, fade the navigation\n  *     controls.  Useful for presentation since the controls are by default\n  *     floated on top of the image the user is viewing.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [immediateRender=false]\n  *     Render the best closest level first, ignoring the lowering levels which\n  *     provide the effect of very blurry to sharp. It is recommended to change\n  *     setting to true for mobile devices.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [defaultZoomLevel=0]\n  *     Zoom level to use when image is first opened or the home button is clicked.\n  *     If 0, adjusts to fit viewer.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [opacity=1]\n  *     Default proportional opacity of the tiled images (1=opaque, 0=hidden)\n  *     Hidden images do not draw and only load when preloading is allowed.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [preload=false]\n  *     Default switch for loading hidden images (true loads, false blocks)\n  *\n  * @property {String} [compositeOperation=null]\n  *     Valid values are 'source-over', 'source-atop', 'source-in', 'source-out',\n  *     'destination-over', 'destination-atop', 'destination-in',\n  *     'destination-out', 'lighter', 'copy' or 'xor'\n  *\n  * @property {String|CanvasGradient|CanvasPattern|Function} [placeholderFillStyle=null]\n  *     Draws a colored rectangle behind the tile if it is not loaded yet.\n  *     You can pass a CSS color value like \"#FF8800\".\n  *     When passing a function the tiledImage and canvas context are available as argument which is useful when you draw a gradient or pattern.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [degrees=0]\n  *     Initial rotation.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [minZoomLevel=null]\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [maxZoomLevel=null]\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [homeFillsViewer=false]\n  *     Make the 'home' button fill the viewer and clip the image, instead\n  *     of fitting the image to the viewer and letterboxing.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [panHorizontal=true]\n  *     Allow horizontal pan.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [panVertical=true]\n  *     Allow vertical pan.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [constrainDuringPan=false]\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [wrapHorizontal=false]\n  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap horizontally within the viewport.\n  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [wrapVertical=false]\n  *     Set to true to force the image to wrap vertically within the viewport.\n  *     Useful for maps or images representing the surface of a sphere or cylinder.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [minZoomImageRatio=0.9]\n  *     The minimum percentage ( expressed as a number between 0 and 1 ) of\n  *     the viewport height or width at which the zoom out will be constrained.\n  *     Setting it to 0, for example will allow you to zoom out infinity.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [maxZoomPixelRatio=1.1]\n  *     The maximum ratio to allow a zoom-in to affect the highest level pixel\n  *     ratio. This can be set to Infinity to allow 'infinite' zooming into the\n  *     image though it is less effective visually if the HTML5 Canvas is not\n  *     availble on the viewing device.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [smoothTileEdgesMinZoom=1.1]\n  *     A zoom percentage ( where 1 is 100% ) of the highest resolution level.\n  *     When zoomed in beyond this value alternative compositing will be used to\n  *     smooth out the edges between tiles. This will have a performance impact.\n  *     Can be set to Infinity to turn it off.\n  *     Note: This setting is ignored on iOS devices due to a known bug (See {@link https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon/issues/952})\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [iOSDevice=?]\n  *     True if running on an iOS device, false otherwise.\n  *     Used to disable certain features that behave differently on iOS devices.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [autoResize=true]\n  *     Set to false to prevent polling for viewer size changes. Useful for providing custom resize behavior.\n  *\n  * @property {Boolean} [preserveImageSizeOnResize=false]\n  *     Set to true to have the image size preserved when the viewer is resized. This requires autoResize=true (default).\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [minScrollDeltaTime=50]\n  *     Number of milliseconds between canvas-scroll events. This value helps normalize the rate of canvas-scroll\n  *     events between different devices, causing the faster devices to slow down enough to make the zoom control\n  *     more manageable.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [pixelsPerWheelLine=40]\n  *     For pixel-resolution scrolling devices, the number of pixels equal to one scroll line.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [visibilityRatio=0.5]\n  *     The percentage ( as a number from 0 to 1 ) of the source image which\n  *     must be kept within the viewport.  If the image is dragged beyond that\n  *     limit, it will 'bounce' back until the minimum visibility ratio is\n  *     achieved.  Setting this to 0 and wrapHorizontal ( or wrapVertical ) to\n  *     true will provide the effect of an infinitely scrolling viewport.\n  *\n  * @property {Object} [viewportMargins={}]\n  *     Pushes the \"home\" region in from the sides by the specified amounts.\n  *     Possible subproperties (Numbers, in screen coordinates): left, top, right, bottom.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [imageLoaderLimit=0]\n  *     The maximum number of image requests to make concurrently. By default\n  *     it is set to 0 allowing the browser to make the maximum number of\n  *     image requests in parallel as allowed by the browsers policy.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [clickTimeThreshold=300]\n  *      The number of milliseconds within which a pointer down-up event combination\n  *      will be treated as a click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [clickDistThreshold=5]\n  *      The maximum distance allowed between a pointer down event and a pointer up event\n  *      to be treated as a click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [dblClickTimeThreshold=300]\n  *      The number of milliseconds within which two pointer down-up event combinations\n  *      will be treated as a double-click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [dblClickDistThreshold=20]\n  *      The maximum distance allowed between two pointer click events\n  *      to be treated as a double-click gesture.\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [springStiffness=6.5]\n  *\n  * @property {Number} [animationTime=1.2]\n  *     Specifies the animation duration per each {@link OpenSeadragon.Spring}\n  *     which occur when the image is dragged or zoomed.\n  *\n  * @property {OpenSeadragon.GestureSettings} [gestureSettingsMouse]\n  *     Settings for gestures generated by a mouse pointer device.
